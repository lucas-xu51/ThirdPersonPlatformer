# COSC416 Assignment 3

## I apologize for losing 0.5 points in **Assignment 2** due to the commit message. However, **Assignment 3** was already completed before the grades for **Assignment 2** were released, which meant I could not change the commit names in **Assignment 3** anymore (my rebase caused conflicts). In the upcoming assignments, I will ensure that commit messages are clear.

## Game Rules

- Use **w**, **a**, **s**, **d** to move in different directions.
- Use **Space** to jump, with the ability for a double jump.
- While holding a direction key, press **e** to activate a speed boost.
- The player can collect blue energy crystals.
